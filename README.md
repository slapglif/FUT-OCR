# FUT-OCR

The point of this project was to learn how to implement and 

# tune Tesseract OCR to replace the need for humans in a specific task.

I'm uploading this in hopes that it, while made by an amature such as my self, 
can help others learn and implement custom OCR solutions.

I want to note that the true secret to the success of this is in image pre-processing, 
as even google's implementation has proven...spotty.

the results were spectacular and I truly hope people can look at this as an example - 
# one of how you use machine-learning and automation to replace the cost and logistics of simple tasks such as data entry.
